## Description

This project aims to develop a bot capable of generating a concise summary of any song, regardless of the language it is in. The bot works as follows: the user provides a YouTube link to a song, and the bot extracts the lyrics from the video. The bot then detects the language of the lyrics and translates them into the language chosen by the user. Finally, the bot generates a brief summary of the song's content in the selected language, giving users a quick understanding of the song's theme and meaning.

The bot is designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and supports multiple languages, making it ideal for anyone who wants to explore music from different cultures and languages.

### Key Features

Automatic extraction of lyrics from YouTube videos
Language detection and translation of song lyrics
Summary generation in the user's preferred language
Multilingual support, allowing interaction with songs in any language
Use Case: The bot can be used by music enthusiasts, language learners, or anyone who wants a quick understanding of a song's content without having to listen to the entire track.
