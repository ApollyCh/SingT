## Project Topic

The project aims to create a bot that generates a brief summary of any song's
lyrics, either by extracting the audio track from a YouTube link or by receiving
an audio file directly. The bot detects the song's language, translates it into
the user's chosen language, and generates a summary.

## Current Status

At the current stage, we have:

- Developed the **functional schema** of the product, outlining the workflow
  from receiving audio input to generating summaries.
- Tested several libraries and models, such as **Whisper** for speech-to-text
  conversion and **langdetect** for language detection.
- Evaluated potential tools for translation and summarization (e.g., GPT-based
  models).
- Integrated basic components of **Aiogram**, a Python library for working with
  the Telegram Bot API, for future bot deployment and interaction with users.

## Data Sources

The project utilizes two types of input data:

- **YouTube video URLs**: The bot can extract audio tracks from videos.
- **Directly uploaded audio files**: Users can send audio files via Telegram,
  and the bot will process them.

Both data types are processed using models for speech-to-text conversion,
language detection, translation, and summarization.

## Scripts

- **YouTube Data Extraction**: This script extracts audio tracks from YouTube
  videos, either by using the YouTube API or scraping methods if necessary.
- **Audio-to-Text Conversion (Whisper)**: We use a speech-to-text model like
  **Whisper** by OpenAI to convert audio tracks (both from YouTube and directly
  uploaded files) into text. This ensures that lyrics are accurately transcribed
  for further processing.
- **Language Detection**: After converting the audio to text, the lyrics are
  processed through a language detection library (e.g., `langdetect` or
  `langid`) to determine the language.
- **Text Translation**: For translation, a Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT
  is used, which preserves the original meaning and context of the song’s
  lyrics.
- **Summarization Model**: Once the lyrics are translated, an LLM-based
  summarization model generates a concise summary of the song's content.
- **Bot Integration (Telegram with Aiogram)**:
  - We use **Aiogram** to build the bot’s interaction with users via Telegram.
  - The bot can accept either a YouTube link or a direct audio file.
  - Upon receiving the input, the bot processes the file, converts speech to
    text using Whisper, and then detects the language, translates the lyrics,
    and provides the user with a summary of the song.

## Intermediate Results

At this stage:

- A **functional schema** of the product has been developed.
- We have tested the core libraries and models, including Whisper for
  speech-to-text conversion, `langdetect` for language detection, and GPT-based
  models for translation and summarization.
- We are in the process of building out the **Telegram bot** using Aiogram, with
  initial setup and integration tested.
- Basic speech-to-text conversion using Whisper has been validated on test data.

## Work Distribution

- **Apollinaria Chernikova**: Responsible for testing machine learning models,
  speech-to-text conversion (Whisper), language detection, and summarization.
- **Egor Machnev**: Focuses on data engineering, integration of YouTube and
  Telegram, bot development using Aiogram, and MLOps tasks.
