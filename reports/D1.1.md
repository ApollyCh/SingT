## Description

This project aims to develop a bot capable of generating a concise summary of any song, regardless of the language it is in. The bot works as follows: the user provides a YouTube link to a song, and the bot extracts the lyrics from the video. The bot then detects the language of the lyrics and translates them into the language chosen by the user. Finally, the bot generates a brief summary of the song's content in the selected language, giving users a quick understanding of the song's theme and meaning.

The bot is designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and supports multiple languages, making it ideal for anyone who wants to explore music from different cultures and languages.

### Key Features

Automatic extraction of lyrics from YouTube videos
Language detection and translation of song lyrics
Summary generation in the user's preferred language
Multilingual support, allowing interaction with songs in any language
Use Case: The bot can be used by music enthusiasts, language learners, or anyone who wants a quick understanding of a song's content without having to listen to the entire track.

## Data Sources

The project primarily works with two types of data:

- YouTube video URLs provided by users, which are used to fetch song metadata and lyrics.
- Song lyrics extracted from the audio or video. These lyrics are processed for language detection and summarization.

For each request, the bot interacts with:
- YouTube API to retrieve song metadata and video captions (or uses web scraping if needed).
- Text data. The extracted song lyrics, used for translation and summarization.

## Scripts
- YouTube data extraction script

  This script handles interaction with the YouTube API. It fetches the video's metadata and, if available, extracts the lyrics or captions. If lyrics aren’t provided by the video, alternative methods like scraping or integrating external APIs (such as Genius for lyrics) might be used.

- Language detection

  After extracting the song's lyrics, it determines the language using a language detection library (such as langdetect or langid). Based on the detected language, it triggers the translation process.

- Text translation

  For the text translation process, a Large Language Model (LLM) is used to ensure high-quality, context-aware translations of the lyrics. Models like OpenAI’s GPT or similar large-scale transformers are integrated into the pipeline to handle multilingual text translation with a high degree of accuracy, preserving the original meaning of the song.

- Summarization model

  Once the lyrics are translated into the user’s chosen language, the same or another LLM is used to generate a concise summary. The LLM provides a brief but insightful overview of the song’s themes, emotions, or narrative. Leveraging transformer-based models allows the bot to produce contextually rich and coherent summaries, which effectively distill the essence of the song.

- Bot integration

  This part manages user interaction and orchestrates the entire workflow. It processes the YouTube links, triggers data extraction, language detection, LLM-powered translation, and summarization, and finally delivers the summary back to the user via the bot interface (e.g., Telegram, Slack).
